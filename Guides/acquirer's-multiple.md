# Takeaways From The Book `The Acquirer's Multiple`

Here are the takeaways from the book...


> *The Acquirer's Multiple buys stocks with mixed profits; some are highly profitable, others break even, and others lose money. It relies on the price mean reverting to the value and the businesses improving*

- Not all growth is good. ***Only businesses earning profits better than the rate required by the market (about 10%) should grow.*** Businesses with profits below that rate turn dollars in earnings into cents on the dollar in business value.

    > *The way I understand this is that, THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ASSETS A COMPANY HAS AND THE HIGHER THE PROFITS IN DOLLARS, THE BETTER. Or, in a sealed package, ***the higher the profit margins (operating margins) compared to competitors (or simply, ROE), the better***.*


## `The Acquirer's Multiple Calculation` --> Enterprise Value / EBIT


- ***FIND THIS DATA FROM YAHOO FINANCE `STATISTICS`, OR BETTER, FROM `https://www.tradingview.com`***


> Enterprise value = (market capitalization + debt - cash)


- WHEN THE COMPANY **HAS CASH (NO DEPT)**

    1. Enterprise Value = Market Cap - Cash
    2. Enterprise Value / Operating Earnings (EBIT) --> THE SMALLER THE BETTER

- WHEN THE COMPANY **HAS DEPT**

    1. Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt
    2. Enterprise Value / Operating Earnings (EBIT) --> THE SMALLER THE BETTER

> **HERE, THE ENTERPRISE VALUE IS KIND OF LIKE THE PRICE YOU PAY, AND OPERATING MARGINS THE VALUE YOU GET!**

*Companies with enterprise values of $0 (and less) do exists. A low or negative enterprise value is a good thing to find. It means the company has little debt and lots of cash relative to the market cap.*
