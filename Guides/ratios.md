# Investing Ratios

Here's stuff about investing, mostly related to investing ratios that are important when deciding whether to invest in a particular asset or not.


## `Ratios`


1. ROC (Return On Capital) A rising ROC is always the goal!

    - (Net Income - Dividends) / (Dept + Equity)

    > *Companies that have a competitive advantage and can sustain that advantage typically have a high return on capital and return on Invested capital (ROIC)!*


2. RORE (Return On Retained Earnings) - A RORE of 12% or more during its most recent five-year-period is the goal!

    - Net Income : Retained Earnings • 100


- Calculate The Time It Takes For The Company To Pay Itself Back If You Would Buy The Whole Company

    - (Shares Outsanding • Prize Of One Share) : Free Cash Flow


- Calculate the capex ratio to know if the company has high Investment costs before it can turn those costs into revenue. To do that:

    - (Capital Expedintures : Cash Flow From Operating Activities) • 100

        - Low Capex = Below 50% ~ **EXCELLENT!**
        - Medium Capex = 50 - 100% ~ **GOOD!**
        - High Capex = Above 100% ~ **AVOID!**


- Calculate the ROCE number (Return On Capital Employed) to know the company’s profitability ratio. To do this:

    - [EBIT : (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)] • 100

        - The ROCE number should be more than 10%!


- Calculate the dividend payout ratio to know the fraction of the net Income a company pays to its stockholders in dividends. To do this:

    - Dividend Per Share • Shares Outstanding = Total Dividends Paid


- And To Calculate The Dividend Payout Ratio…

    - Total Dividends Paid : Net Income = Dividend Payout Ratio!

    ANOTHER WAY TO CALCULATE…

    - Dividends Per Share : Earnings Per Share • 100 = Dividend Payout Ratio!

    *A dividend payout ratio of 0% to 55% is the GOAL! - **THE LOWER, THE BETTER!***


- Remember to also calculate the dividend yield with the current share prize!

    - Annual Dividends Per Share : Current Stock Price • 100


- Calculate the pretax profit margins. Typically, the company with the highest pretax profit margins in the industry are the lowest cost operators and have the best chance of surviving when the times get rough! To do this:

    - Earnings before taxes (Net income + taxes) : Sales (Revenue)

- Calculate the company's book value per share (BVPS) to know the company’s net asset value. To do this: (REMEMBER TO READ THE BALANCE SHEET CAREFULLY TO AVOID ERROR!)

    - (Total assets - Total liabilities = Total Equity) : The number of shares outstanding

***

Example (Coca-cola) 2019:

(86,381B - 67,40B) = Total Equity = $18,981,000,000

18,981,000,000 : 4,294,891,353 ~ $4.42 —> NOT GOOD!

Example (AT&T) 2019:

(545,35B - 367,57B) : 7,125,000,000 ~ $25 —> EXCELLENT!

- Also, remember to calculate the Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS).

- Current Assets - (Total Liabilities + Preferred Stock) : Shares Outstanding

> As a side note, Benhamin Graham's book "The Intelligent Investor" tells that we should buy stocks that have a price of no more than 1,5 times net asset value! This basically means that when the Net Current Asset Value is bigger than the Market Cap, the company is considered undervalued.

- Let's also calculate the company’s book-to-market value! To calculate it:

    - Total Equity : Market Cap

        - (Total assets - Total liabilities) : (The prize of the stock • Total number of shares outstanding)

In the book-to-market ratio case, when the ratio is above 1 then the stock is undervalued; if it is less than 1, the stock is overvalued. A ratio above 1 indicates that the stock price of a company is trading for less than the worth of its assets.

Example (Coca-cola) 2019:

18,981,000,000 : 197,650,000,000 ~ 0.1 —> NOT GOOD!

Example (AT&T) 2019:

184,221,000,000 : 215,960,000,000 ~ 0.9 —> GETTING BETTER!

> *"A book-to-market ratio below 1 implies that investors are willing to pay more for a company than its net assets are worth. This could indicate that the company has healthy future profit projections and the investors are willing to pay a premium for that possibility."*

Technology companies and other companies in industries that do not have a lot of physical assets tend to have a low book-to-market ratio!

Calculate the return on research capital (RORC) to know the amount of profit earned for each dollar spent on research and development within a given period.

- Current Year Gross Profit : Previous Year R&D Expenditures

    - The prior year's R&D expenses are used because the payoff is not typically realized immediately. Rather, it is often realized in some future point in time.

    And The R&D To Revenue:

    > *The Research & Development (R&D) Expense to Revenue ratio measures the percentage of sales that is allocated to R&D expenditures. It is not as effective when looking at companies in different industries because different industries place different values on R&D. Technology companies and pharmaceutical companies are more likely to have high R&D ratios.*

- Research and Development Expense : Total Revenue

    - Example (Apple Inc.) 2019:

        - 98,392,000,000 : 14,236,000,000 ~ $6.91

16,217,000,000 : 260,174,000,000 • 100 ~ 6.23%

- Another great way to calculate it is by using the relationship between a company’s market capitalization and expenses on the research and development. This is called a Price-to-Research Ratio. To calculate it:

    - Market Capitalization : R&D Expense

    - 1,577,697,940,000 : 16,217,000,000 ~ 97.3

        - 97.3 IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR APPLE BECAUSE ITS VALUE ISN’T THEREFORE TIED TO INNOVATIVE ACTIVITIES THAT MUCH!

- The price-to-research ratio is one way to evaluate a company's ability to generate future profits. After all, R&D is a manifestation of a firm's commitment to innovation. Thus, the lower the ratio (that is, the higher the denominator) the more a company's "value" is tied to innovative activities.

    - It is important to note, however, that R&D spending is not a guarantee that future profits from that R&D will ever materialize. Nevertheless, the price-to-research ratio can provide insight into companies that compete within the same industry, because R&D intensity can vary widely. Thus, the definition of a "high" or "low" ratio should be made within this context.

    > REMEMBER! - Companies in the industrial, technological, health care, and pharmaceutical sectors have the highest levels of R&D expenses.

- PEG Ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio)

- P/E : Annual EPS Growth Rate

    - As a general rule, a PEG ratio of 1.0 or lower suggests a stock is fairly priced or even undervalued. A PEG ratio above 1.0 suggests a stock is overvalued.

- *You can try to find dividend stocks with a 3% yield that increases by 10% every year! BUT... The dividend of the stock deserves the least attention! - The reason for this is because the companies that give the dividend the least amount of consideration usually end up getting the best dividend return. These companies invest their money into growth:*

    - A GOOD THING FOR THE SHARE PRICE!

    - The best dividend results will come from low-yield stocks, NOT HIGH-YIELD! Check out "margin of safety" and learn to calculate it!

    - Try to find companies with a margin of safety of at least 25% —> (THE BIGGER THE BETTER!)


## `Useful Annotations`


- When investing in companies you should ask management, *"Who is your toughest competitor. Who else do you admire?"*

- Good companies repurchase their stock opportunistically when the price is below intinsic value - THIS BENEFITS THE SHAREHOLDER!

- When you want your company to succeed, you always need to ask yourself this question: *What are you doing that your competitors aren't doing YET?*

- The company that asks itself this question never becomes complacent. It never gets caught behind and it never starves for intellectual grist to chew through toward a better future.

- This question drives the product market, forcing others to follow and dominating for the betterment of customers, emplyees and shareholders, which is sheer greatness.

**ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION AS AN ENTREPRENEUR!**

The same principle applies to investing. What is the company your Investing doing that their competitors aren't?
