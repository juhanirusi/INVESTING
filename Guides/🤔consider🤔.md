# Other Criterias To Look For...

Here's a list of different signs that make (or don't make) a good company to invest in...

***


## `Positives`

1. A growing level of cash & cash equivalents
2. Stable or growing operating cash flow
3. What the management is doing? How it plans to build future growth? --> What is the company's growth strategy?
4. Insider action --> only buy when the insiders are currently holding or buying more stocks! – Yahoo Finance --> `holders` --> `Insider Transactions`.
5. The company has more than one *"proof of concept"*, which means that a company has more than one successful product.
6. Every single analyst screams "OVERVALUED"

    > *When analysts all agree on something, they tend to be wrong, and if *"overvalued"* is their only criticism of a company, it's extremely telling. Remember, there is a difference between a company having legitimate growth problems and a bunch of analysts being annoyed that their firm didn't buy the stock when it was cheaper.*

7. The founder(s) stick around

    > *A study by Bain Capital showed that of all the S&P 500 companies in which the founder is still involved... performed 3.1 times better than the rest over the past 15 years.*


## `Negatives`

1. If the company founder resigns, investors should head for the exit too!
2. Don't invest in a (tech) company where the founder has left!

## `Price To Cash Flow Ratio (P/CF)`

- To calculate a company's price to cash flow ratio:

    - Share Price / Operating Cash Flow Per Share

> *Generally, a ratio below 15 to 20 is considered good!*

> **NEGATIVE RATIOS ARE NOT A POSITIVE SIGN!**
