## Market Cap To GDP Ratio (*The Buffett Indicator*)

The *Market Cap to GDP Ratio* (also known as *the Buffett Indicator*) is a measure of the total value of all publicly-traded stocks in a country, divided by that country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

It used as a broad way of assessing whether the country's stock market is overvalued or undervalued, compared to a historical average. It is a form of Price/Sales valuation multiple for an entire country. The market cap to GDP ratio is as follows:

> `Value of all public stocks in a country` / `The gross domestic product of a country` x 100

...anything above 100% is overvalued and everything under it is undervalued!
