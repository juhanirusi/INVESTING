# Modeling & Valuation Best Practices

1. Modeling is easier than you think and a lot of fun, if you remember 2 key items:

    1. `MOST ITEMS YOU MODEL ARE SIMPLY A % OF REVENUE!`
    2. The second key item to remember is that `MODELING IS ALL ABOUT LOOKING FOR PATTERNS AND THEN PROJECTING THOSE PATTERNS INTO THE FUTURE.`

2. Publicly traded companies are often quite large and, as a result, although growth is positive, growth is usually decelerating.

3. If growth is not decelerating for a large publicly traded company, then it might be because they made a sizeable acquisition.

4. When a big company sees a significant decrease in the rate of change of revenue growth, they usually focus on increasing margins.

5. Use your own common sense and build the model yourself before speaking with the company about your estimates (**THEY KNOW HOW TO SELL!**).

6. If a company has a lot of cash, they either make acquisitions or they buy back shares. Look for patterns in the share count.

7. Forecasting taxes is tough. Find out from the 10-k or 10-q what the N.O.L.s are and after you exhaust them, ask IR for guidance.

8. `ALWAYS USE AT LEAST 3 VALUATION METHODOLOGIES TO COME UP WITH YOUR TARGET PRICE. THEN TAKE AN AVERAGE OF ALL 3.`

9. Create a sensitivity analysis to see how your target price changes with different growth and discount rate amounts.

10. Create bearish, neutral (*"just right"*) and bullish scenarios too if you are highly unsure what the economic environment will be like.

11. If you feel overwhelmed with the complexity of a model, build it slowly and "group" items.

12. Modeling can often be as much of a science as an art. Accept the fact that your estimates will never be 100% correct.

13. Listen to earnings calls, read IR's press releases and all 10-q, 10-k, 8-k and S1 filings and reflect those calls/documents in your model.

14. Creating a model takes time. When I think I am done with my model, I sleep on it and do 1 final review the next morning.

15. Know what the size the Total Addressable Market (T.A.M.) is and use it as a sanity check to see if your estimates seem realistic.


## `Excel Tips`

1. Items that you hard code (meaning anything that is in your model that is not a calculation) should be in a blue font.

2. Cells that contain data from other tabs in your spreadsheet should be in a green font.

3. If you work in teams (as you do often on the sell side or in investment banking), then please add many comments (with your initials).

4. Add all supplemental data provided by IR in your models (at the bottom of the model if you don't know where to put it).

5. Percent items should be *italicized*... in fact spend a lot of time *"prettying up"* your model. It
makes sure your attention to detail is high.

6. Name your rows and columns so you can use natural language math like: `"net income / revenue"` instead of `cell x3 / t8`.

7. Feel comfortable with `$A$1` to lock in cell references, `$A1` row only references and `A$1` column only references (huge time saver).


## `PROFESSIONAL Financial Analyst Tips`

1. Understand who your customer is. If it's a hedge fund, then they likely don't like DCF. If it's a value PM at a mutual fund, they do, etc.
