# Income Statement Analysis

How to do a company's income statements analysis.


## Gross Profit Margin

- *The gross profit margin is a measure of productivity and efficiency.*

To calculate a company’s gross profit margin:

⚠️ **(Revenue - Cost Of Goods Sold) / Revenue * 100**

You should compare the company’s gross profit margin to the industry average and other companies in the same industry!

NOT TO COMPANIES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES! —> INVESTING.COM!

Gross profit margin should always be positive (preferably at least 10%)!

Avoid companies with a negative gross profit margin!


## Operating Profit Margin

- *The operating margin is an indicator of how efficiently a company controls the costs associated with its routine operations.*

- *The operating profit margin looks at a company’s performance in its core business but can differ significantly from net income.*

To calculate a company’s operating profit margin:

⚠️ Operating Income / Revenue * 100

The operating profit margin should always be positive!

Avoid companies with a negative operating profit margin!


## Net Profit Margin

To calculate a company’s net profit margin:

Try to look for companies that have a higher operating profit margin than it’s competitors and industry average! —> INVESTING.COM

⚠️ Net Income / Revenue

If the net profit margin is stable or improving, that is a positive sign, if declining, negative! If the net profit margin swings from period to period, look for signs that may have caused it. —> Not necessarily negative!

The net profit margin should always be positive (preferably over 10%)!

Try to avoid companies with a margin lower than 10%!


## Cash Return On Assets

- *The cash return on assets (cash ROA) is a measure of performance efficiency.*
- *Cash ROA is much less subject to distortation by accounting methods! 👍*

To calculate the company’s cash ROA:

⚠️ Cash Flows From Operations / Total Assets

A high cash ROA ratio means the company earns more net income from $1 of assets than the average company, which is a sign of efficiency.

A low cash ROA ratio means a company makes less net income per $1 of assets, which is a sign of inefficiency.


## Return On Debt

- *Return on debt measures how much profit a company generated with its debt.*
- *ROD is a complex measure, so it’s less used.*

To calculate a company’s return on debt ratio:

⚠️ Net Income / Long Term Debt


## Return On Capital Employed

- *The return on capital employed ratio (ROCE) measures how profitable a company is and how efficiently it uses it’s capital.*
- *ROCE is a better measure than ROE!*

To calculate a company’s return on capital employed ratio:

⚠️ Earnings Before Interest & Taxes / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) * 100

ROCE should be examined against previous returns achieved by the business. If the ROCE starts to decline, this is a negative sign also!

If ROCE is lower than the company’s cost of capital, this is a significant negative sign!


## Total Asset Turnover Ratio

To calculate a company’s total asset turnover ratio:

⚠️ Revenue / Total Assets

Find the company with the highest total asset turnover ratio in the industry!


## Cash Coverage Ratio

- *The cash coverage ratio measures a company’s ability to pay it’s short-term obligations solely with its cash and cash equivalents.*

To calculate a company’s cash coverage ratio:

⚠️ Cash & Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities

A ratio that is close to 1 or higher is ideal but almost impossible for companies operating in a certain industry, so if the ratio is higher than the industry average —> 👍

A LOW RATIO NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG, PREDICTABLE, STABLE CASH FLOWS! —> Retail (WALMART Inc, for example)


## Current Cash Debt Coverage Ratio

To calculate a company’s current cash debt coverage ratio:

⚠️ Current Year Total Liabilities + Previous Year Total Liabilities) / 2 = Average Total Liabilities

Cash From Operating Activities / Average Total Liabilities

A company with strong cash flow should have a good CCDCR even if its current asset ratios are weak! A HIGH CCRCR IS A POSITIVE SIGN!


## Cash To Working Capital Ratio

To calculate a company's cash to working capital ratio:

⚠️ Cash & Cash Equivalents / (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)

For most companies, a favorable number is around 1.00; a very low or high number indicates potential problems!
