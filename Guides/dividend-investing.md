⚠️ Dividend Per Share / Earnings Per Share

A dividend payout ratio between 20% - 60% is considered GOOD!

Above 60% ISN'T GOOD!

⚠️ Look For Companies With A Dividend Yield Of At Least 4%

A dividend yield between 2% to 6% is optimal!


## Credit Rating

⚠️ Look For Companies That Have A Credit Rating Of B+ Or Better
