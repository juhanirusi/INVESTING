# Summary Of Finding A Good Company To Invest In


1. Management should get compensation from real results, not raising stock price quarterly!

2. The company needs to be stable and understandable, which means that your investment reduces risk

3. The company NEEDS TO have a moat that can come in many forms like intangibles, low-cost structures, or high switching costs (stickiness)

4. Always try to have a bigger return on your investment than the federally issued bond. For example, if the bond has a 7% yield, aim for a discount rate that's 14%

5. Margin of safety is the difference between the intrinsic value and the current market price. **You want as much margin as possible to minimize risk!**

6. The P/E ratio below 15 is a rule of thumb and a good starting point to find decently priced stocks. The lower the P/E  the less you have to pay for $1 of earnings.

7. A P/B value below 1.5 is a rule of thumb and a good starting point for reducing your exposure to risk. **A key ratio of 1 means that the investor pays $1 of price of every $1 of equity in the company**.

    - If the company has a high P/B, you can minimize that risk by if the company has a very large moat (i.e., a valuable brand and/or patent).

8. We want the *Cash Flow From Operations* to be **AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE**, because that shows how well the company is able to make money out of it's core business operations. The other cash flows represent:

    - Cash from INVESTING activites --> Selling assets
    - Cash from FINANCING activites --> Taking a loan

9. Finding a good starting point for determining a future growth estimate for the company is the growth of book value.

    - To calculate BOOK VALUE PER SHARE = **Equity / Shares Outstanding**
    - To calculate average annual book value growth = **(Present Year Book Value - Previous Year Book Value) / Previous Year Book Value**

        - DO THIS FOR +5 YEARS AND CALCULATE THE AVERAGE GROWTH!

    - ***BOOK VALUE GROWTH AND THE GROWTH OF ROE SHOULD BE QUITE SIMILAR!***

## Important Ratios

1. A *debt-to-equity ratio* below 0.5 is preferred.

2. A more conservative ratio is the *liabilities-to-equity* ratio. A ratio below 0.8 is considered a low-risk investment. ***THIS RATIO IS GOOD BECAUSE IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INTEREST BEARING DEBT!***

    - Total Liabilities / Equity

3. *Current ratio* should be at least 1.5, but preferably below 5

    > Below 5, because that would mean that the management of the company don't know how to do capital allocation well enough!

4. *ROE (Return on equity)* above 8% is a target (DEBT TO EQUITY IS MORE IMPORTANT!)

5. *ROA (Return on assets)*, also called *ROI (Return on investment)*

    > NOT IMPORTANT IF COMPANY HAS LOW LEVEL OF DEBT, BUT **IF COMPANY HAS A LOT OF DEBT, THIS VALUE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ROE!**

    > ROA of above 6% is a target, but **having a best value in the industry is more important!**

6. For commpanies in the same industry, use these metrics to find the best investment in a particular market industry:

    1. **Gross Profit Margin Ratio** --> Gross Profit / Revenue

        - *How effective the company is at controlling costs*

    2. **Operating margin ratio** --> Income From Operations / Revenue

        - *How effective the business is at it's day-to-day operations*

    3. **Net Income Margin Ratio** --> Net Income / Revenue

        - *How effective the company was in turning revenue into profit*

    4. **Interest Coverage Ratio** --> Income From Operations / Interest Expense

        - *How effective the company is at paying the interest of their loans and keep their "head above the water"* --> GOAL OF AT LEAST 5 TIMES THE OPERATING INCOME!

    5. **Inventory Turnover Ratio** --> Cost Of Revenue / Inventory

        - *How effective the company is at selling the products in their inventory*
        - 4 is the preferred number, but the best or above industry average is preferred!

    6. **Accounts Reveivable Turnover Ratio** --> Turnover / Accounts Receivables

        - How effectively the company's customers pay their bills.
        - The higher number the better, or lower amount of days the better --> THE COMPANY GETS THEIR MONEY BACK QUICKLY!

        > You can also calculate the amount of days it gets the customers to pay --> 365 / ARTR

    7. **Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio** --> Cost Of Revenue / Accounts Payable

        - How long it takes for the company to pay back it's suppliers.
        - A ratio of 2-6 is typically efficient
        - In general, we like this number to be high, so that the company is paying it's bills quickly, but a low number isn't bad either if that loan is interest free.

        > You can also calculate the amount of days it gets the customers to pay --> 365 / APTR


## Important Quotes & Notes

> *I think everyone can agree that simply buying stock in a great company doesn't mean you'll make a profit. Unbeknownst to most, the success of a stock pick heavily relies on the purchase price as much as the productivity of the already-successful business.*

> *Every investment you ever make and involves risk, so it **NEEDS TO** yield more than the 10-year treasury note, because what's the point of investing, if you could just place your money on bonds that have minimal risk. So the minimum rate of return for an investment should **ALWAYS** be the yield of a 10-year treasury bond!*

> *Because of stock-option grants and accounting gains and charges, EPS alone isn't a good metric. Instead ***Return On Invested Capital (ROIC)*** is a better indicator of showing what the company earns from its operating business and how efficiently it has used the shareholders money to generate that return. A ROIC of ***at least 10% is attractive, but even 6% or 7% can be tempting*** if the company has good brand names, focused management, or is under temporary cloud.*
