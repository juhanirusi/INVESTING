# The Warren Buffett Way...


Warren Buffett is mostly a great businessman, because the way he actually created he's wealth was by ***using GEICO's insurance premiums to create capital to invest in other businesses and issue Berkshire Hathaway stock and then, of course, buying the shares back, which raised the value of the business even further***.


Look for "franchise" companies with ***strong consumer brands, easily understandable businesses, robust financial health, and near-monopolies in their markets***, like H&R Block, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co.

Buffet also likes to ***snap up a stock when a scandal, big loss, or other bad news passes over it like a storm cloud*** – as when he bought Coca-Cola soon after its disastrous rollout of "New Coke" and the market crash of 1987.

He also wants to see managers who ***set and meet realistic goals***; build their businesses from within rather than through acquisition; allocate capital wisely; and do not pay themselves hundred-million-dollar jackpots of stock options.

Buffett insists on ***steady and sustainable growth in earnings***, so the company will be worth more in the future than it is today.


So, in a sealed package:

***

- Strong Brand
- Near-monopoly
- Robust Financial Health
- Easily Understandable Business

+ BUY THE STOCK...

- DURING A SCANDAL.
- WHEN THE COMPANY FACES A BIG LOSS.
- OTHER BAD NEWS PASS OVER THE COMPANY.

*Another important thing to remember is to determine whether technology will significantly change the demand or use of the product. If it can, you should probably consider a alternate investment object—or at least assume the risks associated with such a venture and be prepared for its consequences / rewards.*


# What Kind Of Stocks To Avoid?

1. The hottest stocks in the hottest industry. - **"The one's that everyone's talking about."**

2. A stock touted as the **"Next Something"** - A stock touted as the *"Next Apple" or "Next Microsoft"*

3. **Companies that "di-worsify"** - Profitable companies that diversify by acquiring other companies.

4. **Whisper Stocks** - Companies with ambitious goals like curing AIDS or solving drug addiction without any earnings. **"Companies That Sound Too Good To Be True!"** --> *IPOs for example!*

5. Companies that are dependent on a BIG and major customer.

6. Companies with ***flashy*** names.

> *"The intelligent investors realizes that stocks become more risky, not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks more costly to buy. And conversely, as long as you keep enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs, you should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale."*

    - Benjamin Graham


> *Don't be influenced by what doesn't matter. Statistics of former years' earnings and particularly of per-share prize ranges of the former years quite frequently "have nothing to do with the case."* —-> **All of this means that past earnings are never a certainty of a company's future earnings!**


## Research The Management

Research the management. **Read the proxy statement** and find out if the management is working as a team AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO, or if it's a one man team.

- So, check out the proxy statement, and see if the salary of the number one man is a lot larger than the salaries of the second and third ones. **THIS IS A BIG RED FLAG!**

Also, remember that **stock options shouldn't be part of an executive's compensation.** After all, exceptional **managers who earn cash bonuses based on the performance of their business can simply buy the company stock if they want to**, and if they do, they *"truly walk in the shoes of owners."*
