# DFS Calculator Basic Info

Here's some basic info when valuing companies with DFS calculators...


1. For mature companies, a 5-year explicit forecast period is suitable and for startups or high growth companies, a 10-year forecast period gives you a more accurate valuation, but still, **the 10-year model is the most reliable and commonly used**.


2. Gordon Growth Method

    - We care about this because everyone uses this formula to calculate Terminal Value in a DCF, but hardly anyone explains where it comes from. The basic idea is that you can pay more for a company that's growing its cash flows than for one that's NOT growing its cash flows.

    - And to represent that, you use the formula:

        - Final Year, Projected Period Free Cash Flow * (1 + FCF Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate – FCF Growth Rate).

    - To approximate the amount you could pay for the Free Cash Flows in the Terminal Period – which is the Terminal Value in a DCF.
