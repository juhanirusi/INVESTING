# What Numbers Do We Need?

What numbers do we need to build a DFS calculator?


1. Unlevered free cash flow

2. WACC

    - D / (D + E) * kd * (1 - t) + E / (D + E) * ke

    1. `D` = Debt
    2. `E` = Equity


## Some Guides...

1. Cost of debt --> All borrowings a firm has and will have at the time of the valuation.

    - Cost Of Debt ==> `Interest Expense / Financial Liabilities`

2. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

    - E(ri) = rf + β(E(rm) - rf)

    1. `E(ri)` = Company's Cost Of Equity
    2. `rf` = Risk Free Rate (*Rate of return the investor expects from a financial security with zero default risk.*)
    3. `β` = Beta (*Shows how a financial security is correlated with the financial returns of the rest of the market.*)
    4. `E` = Equity
    5. `rm` = Market Risk Premium (The average expected return of the market minus the risk-free rate.)

        - *Average historical MRP ≈ 5.3% to 5.7%*
