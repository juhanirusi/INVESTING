# Basic Calculations To Make

Before you invest in any company ask yourself this question:

🤔 **In 5 Years, Will This Company Be More Relevant Than It Is Today!**

How do we assess if a CEO or an entrepreneur is worth backing? We can use Glassdoor.com (http://www.glassdoor.com/) and read reviews of the management team written by employees.


## PEGY Ratio

- *PEGY ratio is the enhanced version of the PEG ratio.*

To calculate a company’s PEGY ratio:

⚠️ **P/E Ratio / EPS Growth Rate + Dividend Yield**

This ratio is only for companies that pay a dividend!

With this ratio, you should try to find stocks that have a PEGY ratio equal to or lower than 1!

Do not rely on this ratio if you evaluate a stock with a high dividend yield! (more than 8%!) You shouldn’t be investing in a high dividend yield company anyway!
