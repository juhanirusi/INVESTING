# Find Companies To Invest In...


1. Run stock screeners to look for:

    1. *Companies with market caps between $50M-$500M that have seen their stock decline more than 25% in the trailing 6 months.*

    2. *Rule out companies that are iffy (lack transparency, susceptible to pump and dumps, inhibitable low volume) and run financial analyses on each of the remaining companies to see if their recent financials (typically past 2-3 quarters) justify the negative stock performance.*

    3. *If a given company has strong financials, a low P/E, open a small position to lock in a low cost.*

    4. *If the stock starts turning around within a few weeks of when you come across it, start building up my position.*
