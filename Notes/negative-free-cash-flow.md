# Is Negative Free Cash Flow Always Bad?


*In my opinion, the best companies to buy are ones that have large and growing amounts of free cash flow. One possible drawback of this approach is that you will ignore companies with small or even negative free cash flows because they are investing heavily in new assets to grow their future sales, profits and operating cash flows.*


## `Should you really ignore companies like this?`


*Not necessarily. Ideally you will try to find companies that don't need to spend a lot of capex to grow. However, if you come across what appears to be a quality company that is spending a lot of money, then you need to make sure the company is getting a good return on that investment.*

*You need to ***LOOK AT THE TREND IN ROCE AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT FREE CASH FLOW. IF ROCE IS HIGH AND RISING WHILST A COMPANY IS SPENDING HEAVILY THEN THE COMPANY COULD START GENERATING LOTS OF FREE CASH FLOW WHEN ITS SPENDING SETTLES DOWN*** - if it ever does.*

*The main issue is how much money the company needs to spend to maintain its assets in a steady state.*

*The point here is that you might be making a mistake by ignoring companies with low or negative free cash flow. There could be a great cash flow business waiting to blossom.*


> **IN SUMMARY, `KEEP AN EYE ON COMPANIES THAT HAVE A HIGH CAPEX TO DEPRECIATION RATIO, AND A GROWING ROCE (RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED)`. THESE COMPANIES COULD GENERATE CASH FLOWS FOR INVESTORS IN THE FUTURE IF ROCE IS MAINTAINED.**
