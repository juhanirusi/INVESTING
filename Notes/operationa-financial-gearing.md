# `What Are Operational And Financial Gearing?`

Here's some info about operational and financial gearing...


## `Operational Gearing`

*Operational gearing (or operating leverage) is a financial metric that measures the extent to which a company's costs are fixed versus variable. It reflects how a company's profit is affected by changes in sales volume.*


- **KEY CONCEPTS**


    1. `Fixed Costs` --> *These are costs that remain constant regardless of the level of production or sales. Examples include rent, salaries of permanent staff, and depreciation.*

    2. `Variable Costs` --> *These costs vary directly with the level of production or sales. Examples include raw materials, direct labor, and sales commissions.*

    3. `Contribution Margin` --> *This is the difference between sales revenue and variable costs. It represents the portion of sales that contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit.*


- **IMPACT OF OPERATIONAL GEARING**


    1. `High Operational Gearing` --> *This occurs when a company has a high proportion of fixed costs relative to its total costs. Such companies experience a more significant impact on profits from changes in sales volume. A small increase in sales can lead to a large increase in profits, but a small decrease in sales can cause a substantial drop in profits.*

    2. `Low Operational Gearing` --> *This occurs when a company has a lower proportion of fixed costs. Profits are less sensitive to changes in sales volume. This can be more stable but less responsive to sales growth.*


- **WHY IT'S IMPORTANT**


    1. `Risk` --> *High operational gearing means higher risk in times of sales volatility.*

    2. `Profitability` --> *Companies with high fixed costs can potentially make higher profits during sales booms.*

    3. `Decision-Making` --> *Helps in pricing, cost management, and investment decisions.*


## `Financial Gearing`


*Financial gearing (also known as financial leverage) refers to the extent to which a company uses debt to finance its operations as opposed to equity. It indicates the level of financial risk a company takes on and how much of its capital structure is made up of borrowed funds.*


- **KEY CONCEPTS**


    1. `Debt` --> *Money that the company borrows, typically through loans or issuing bonds, which must be repaid with interest.*

    2. `Equity` --> *The capital invested by shareholders, including retained earnings and funds raised by issuing shares.*

    3. `Interest Payments` --> *Costs associated with debt, which are fixed and must be paid regardless of the company's profitability.*


- **IMPACT OF FINANCIAL GEARING**


    1. `High Financial Gearing` --> *A company with a high proportion of debt relative to equity. This increases financial risk because the company must make regular interest payments regardless of its earnings. However, during periods of strong profitability, leveraging debt can amplify returns on equity (ROE) due to the lower cost of debt compared to equity financing.*

    2. `Low Financial Gearing` --> *A company with more equity financing and less reliance on debt. This is generally safer, as it reduces the burden of fixed interest payments, making the company less vulnerable to financial distress during downturns.*


- **WHY IT'S IMPORTANT**


    1. `Risk Assessment` --> *High financial gearing increases the risk of insolvency during economic downturns since debt obligations are fixed.*

    2. `Return on Equity (ROE)` --> *In favorable conditions, high financial gearing can enhance ROE, as debt is usually cheaper than equity and interest is tax-deductible.*

    3. `Cost of Capital` --> *Financial gearing affects a company’s cost of capital. The optimal balance between debt and equity can lower the overall cost of financing.*

    4. `Investor Insight` --> *Investors use financial gearing ratios to evaluate a company’s financial structure and risk profile, helping in investment decisions.*


- **PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS**


    1. *A `highly geared company` can be more profitable in good times but riskier in bad times due to the burden of fixed interest payments.*

    2. *A `low-geared company` may be less risky but might not maximize shareholder returns during periods of high growth.*
