# How Can The VIX Index Help You With Investing?

*The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) or the "fear Index" is a real-time market index extensively used by investors to evaluate market sentiment and perceived risk. By representing the expected volatility of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, the VIX acts as a barometer of investor fear and uncertainty, making it a crucial indicator in assessing market dynamics. Simply put: VIX is the expected volatility over the next 30 days.*

The VIX typically rises as the stock market falls, reflecting increased volatility and investor as well as consumer anxiety. If you buy when the VIX is high, you are buying the dip.

## Interpreting the VIX


- Low VIX (e.g., below 15): Investors are complacent/confident; markets are stable.
- Moderate VIX (15 - 25): Typical day-to-day uncertainty.
- High VIX (above 30): Fear and stress dominate; investors expect turbulence.

*When the VIX spikes, it usually means stocks are falling fast - investors are scrambling for protection via options.*

That's why people say --> `When the VIX is high, it's time to buy!` - This reflects contrarian thinking, because extreme fear often marks market bottoms.


## The "VIX Above 70" Comment By Chris Haroun

- VIX readings above 70 are very rare, typically during extreme market crises:

    - 2008 Financial Crisis (VIX ==> 80)
    - March 2020 COVID crash (VIX ==> 82)

- If you had invested in the S&P 500 at either of those moments, your returns over the next few years would have been excellent. Buying when VIX > 70 almost guarantees strong returns has historical truth, but it's not a formal rule. It works because:

    - Such VIX levels reflect peak panic and maximum risk aversion.
    - Market bottoms often occur around these panic points.

BUT IT’S NOT A GUARANTEE, JUST A VERY STRONG HISTORICAL TENDENCY!
