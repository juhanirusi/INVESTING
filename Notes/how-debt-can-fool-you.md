# How Debt Can Fool You


*Companies can use debt to create a misleading picture of their financial health and performance. The key idea is that debt can artificially inflate certain financial ratios, particularly the Return on Equity (ROE), without improving the company's actual operating efficiency or profitability. So, do not be fooled by the apparent improvement in ROE that comes from increased debt. Instead, you should look at ROCE and other measures like interest cover to gauge the true health and performance of a company. High levels of debt increase financial risk, potentially jeopardizing the company's stability in the face of declining profits or asset values.*


## `Key Concepts`


1. `Financial Engineering`


    - *Companies can engage in financial engineering by replacing equity with debt. This changes the company's capital structure without improving its core operations.*

    - *For example, a company like Bob’s Book Shop, which originally has no debt, can take on debt and reduce equity, thereby increasing its ROE significantly.*


2. `Impact on ROE and ROCE`


    - *ROE (Return on Equity) increases because the equity base shrinks while the profit drop due to interest payments is less severe in percentage terms.*

    - *ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) remains unchanged because the total capital employed in the business does not change. This indicates that the operational efficiency of the company is still the same.*


3. `Why Debt Increases ROE`


    - Debt lowers the equity base while reducing post-tax profits due to interest expenses. Since the reduction in equity is proportionally larger than the reduction in profits, the ROE increases.

    - However, this increase is not due to better business performance but merely due to changes in financial structuring.


4. `Increased Risk to Shareholders`


    - Although ROE improves, the risk to shareholders increases because:

        - Interest Cover declines, making it harder for the company to cover interest payments if profits drop.

        - Debt-to-Assets Ratio increases, meaning a higher proportion of the company's assets are financed by debt. This raises the risk of equity devaluation if asset values fall.


5. `Misleading Financial Indicators`


    - Focusing solely on ROE can be misleading. A company might seem more profitable due to higher ROE, but this could simply be the result of higher financial leverage (debt) rather than genuine improvements in business performance.

    - ROCE provides a clearer picture of the company’s operational performance and efficiency since it considers the total capital employed.
