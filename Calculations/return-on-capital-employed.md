# Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)


*Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial ratio companies use to gauge their performance. ROCE is an indicator of a company's efficiency because it measures the company's profitability after factoring in the capital used to achieve that profitability.*


> *But be sure to compare the ROCE of companies within the same industry as those from different sectors tend to have varying ratios; however, it's generally a given that having a ratio of 15% to 20% or more means that a company is doing well.*
