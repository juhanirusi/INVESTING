# `Interest Cover Ratio`


*The Interest Cover Ratio measures how many times a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) can cover its interest expenses. A higher ratio indicates greater financial stability, as it shows that the company can comfortably meet its interest obligations.*


(`EBIT` / `Interest Payable`)

## Implications of Interest Cover Ratio:


- `High Ratio (> 10)` --> *Indicates the company can comfortably meet its interest obligations, suggesting low financial risk.*

- `Moderate Ratio (5 - 10)` --> *The company is in a relatively safe position but should monitor its debt servicing capacity.*

- `Low Ratio (< 3)` --> *Indicates higher financial risk, as the company may struggle to meet its interest obligations, especially during downturns or if earnings decline.*


## What the Interest Cover Ratio Tells Us:


- `Debt Servicing Ability` --> *It shows the company’s ability to pay interest on its debt using its earnings before taxes and interest.*

- `Financial Health` --> *A higher ratio suggests a safer company with lower risk of defaulting on interest payments.*

- `Buffer for Earnings Decline` --> *A higher ratio provides a cushion for earnings to decline before the company faces difficulty in paying interest.*
