# `Debtor Ratio`


*The debtor ratio, also known as the "accounts receivable turnover ratio" or "trade receivables" ratio (if you Google these ratios though, the the calculations are a bit different where turnover is divided by trade debtors instead!), measures the percentage of a company's turnover (revenue) tied up in trade debtors (accounts receivable). This ratio can reveal how efficiently a company collects revenue from its customers and whether there are signs of aggressive accounting practices.*


(`Trade Debtors (Receivables)` / `Turnover (Revenue)`) * 100


> *A rising debtor ratio across industries could suggest inefficiencies or riskier credit practices, especially if it deviates from the industry average.*

## Interpretation of Debtor Ratio


- `Low Debtor Ratio` --> *Indicates that the company collects its receivables quickly and has minimal amounts of its revenue tied up in unpaid invoices.*

- `High Debtor Ratio` --> *Suggests that a significant portion of sales is on credit, which can be a red flag if it is rising sharply. This could mean the company is offering too generous credit terms or having trouble collecting payments.*


## What the Debtor Ratio Tells Us


- `Efficiency of Credit Policy` --> *It shows how well a company manages its credit sales and collection.*

- `Liquidity Indicator` --> *A lower ratio generally indicates better liquidity as cash is not tied up in unpaid sales.*

- `Risk of Bad Debts` --> *Higher ratios may indicate a higher risk of bad debts if customers delay or fail to make payments.*


## Implications of Changes in Creditor Levels


- `High Cash Outflows to Creditors` --> *Can signal weakened financial standing if suppliers demand faster payments.*

- `Loss of Buying Power` --> *Suggests a potential decline in the company's leverage over its suppliers, possibly indicating financial distress.*
