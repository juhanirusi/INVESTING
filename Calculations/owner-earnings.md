# Owner Earnings


*Owner Earnings is a conservative measure of a company's cash profits, introduced by Warren Buffett, to provide a more accurate representation of the cash available to shareholders. It adjusts reported net income by adding back non-cash charges and subtracting an estimate of the capital expenditure necessary to maintain the company's current operations (maintenance capex).*


`Net Income` + `Depreciation & Amortization` + `Other Non-Cash Items` - `Maintenance Capex`


## Steps to Estimate Maintenance Capex


1. `Direct Company Information` --> *Use the figure if the company provides it.*

2. `Percentage of Depreciation and Amortization` --> *Use a percentage like 120% of depreciation and amortization.*

3. `Historical Average Capex` --> *Take a 5- or 10-year average from the Cash Flow Statement (investmentsInPropertyPlantAndEquipment or capitalExpenditure).*


## What Owner Earnings Tell Us


1. `Cash Available to Shareholders` --> *It provides a clearer picture of the cash that can be distributed to shareholders or reinvested without impairing the company’s future operations.*

2. `Conservative Valuation` --> *Offers a more prudent measure than net income, reflecting the company's true earning power.*

3. `Investment Risk` --> *A higher owner earnings figure suggests a lower risk of overpaying for a company, as it’s based on conservative cash profit estimates.*
