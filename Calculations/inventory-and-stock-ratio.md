# Inventory & Stock Ratio


*The stock ratio is a useful tool to gauge how efficiently a company manages its inventory in relation to its sales, with a rising stock ratio potentially signaling operational inefficiencies or weakened demand.*


(`Stock (Inventory)` / `Turnover (Revenue)`) * 100


> *A gradual or consistent increase in inventory can be normal if it's in anticipation of higher future sales.*

> *However, if inventory rises without a corresponding increase in sales, it may suggest problems like overproduction or declining demand.*

## Interpretation of Stock Ratio


- `Low Ratio` --> *Indicates efficient inventory management, where most goods are sold quickly, keeping inventory levels low relative to sales.*

- `High Ratio` --> *Could suggest inefficiency, such as overstocking or slow-moving inventory, potentially leading to future price reductions to clear excess stock and thus reducing future profits.*


## Relevance by Industry


> *The stock ratio is especially critical for ***MANUFACTURING AND RETAILING*** companies, where inventory plays a significant role in operations. These sectors need to maintain optimal inventory levels to balance supply with demand effectively without overcommitting cash resources to stock.*
