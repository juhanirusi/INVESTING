# `Free Cash Flow Per Share & EPS Difference`


*Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Free Cash Flow Per Share (FCFps) are two critical metrics for evaluating a company's financial health. However, they often diverge due to the nature of how profits and cash flows are recorded.*


## Why EPS and FCFps Differ...


- *EPS is calculated based on profits, which smooth out revenues and costs over time, adhering to accounting principles.*

- *FCFps reflects the actual cash a company generates, which can be irregular and fluctuate more significantly.*


## Key Reasons for Disparities


1. `Poor Operating Cash Conversion`

    - *When a company grows rapidly and sells on credit, profits may be recorded on the income statement before cash is actually received.*

    - *Companies might also increase inventory, which delays cash realization but can temporarily boost profits by deferring expenses.*

    - *Excessive credit sales or stockpiling could indicate overtrading or even fictitious sales, which are red flags for investors.*

2. `High Investment in New Assets`

    - *If Capital Expenditures (Capex) greatly exceed depreciation, it reduces FCFps even though it doesn’t immediately impact EPS.*

    - *High Capex is acceptable if it leads to better returns (ROCE) over time, but persistent high Capex without improving ROCE can suggest manipulative accounting, where expenses are shifted to Capex to inflate profits.*


## Implications for Investors


- *A consistently lower FCF per share compared to EPS may signal financial manipulation or inefficient operations.*

- *Conversely, when FCFps closely aligns with EPS, IT INDICATES A COMPANY'S REPORTED PROFITS ARE MORE CLOSELY TIED TO ACTUAL CASH GENERATION, which is a sign of financial health and transparency.*


## Rules of Thumb for Evaluating FCF Per Share vs. EPS


1. `FCFps ≥ 80% of EPS` --> *Strong candidate for investment.*

2. `FCFps < 80% of EPS, but ROCE is rising` --> *Potentially good investment; monitor ROCE.*

3. `FCFps < 80% of EPS, with declining ROCE` --> *Avoid; may indicate poor financial management or manipulation.*

4. `Consistently Negative FCFps` --> *Avoid, suggests persistent cash flow issues.*
