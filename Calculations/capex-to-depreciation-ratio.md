# Capex to Depreciation Ratio


*The depreciation to capex ratio is crucial in assessing whether a company is adequately reinvesting in its assets to maintain operational capacity and growth. Comparing this ratio with industry peers and historical data can offer deeper insights into a company's investment strategy and financial health. ***An optimal ratio, along with a rising ROCE***, can signal that the company is poised for sustainable growth and enhanced free cash flow generation.*


(`Capex` / `Depreciation (or Depreciation and Amortization)`) * 100

## Interpretation of the Depreciation to Capex Ratio


- `Low Ratio (< 100%)` --> *Could mean the company is not investing enough to maintain its asset base, which might lead to asset deterioration and could impact future operations negatively.*

- `High Ratio (> 100%)` --> *Suggests that the company is investing more in assets than the value lost through depreciation, indicating growth or asset replacement.*

- `Industry Comparisons` --> *It's crucial to compare this ratio with industry peers, as capital intensity varies across sectors.*


## Can Depreciation and Amortization Be Used?


- *Depreciation applies to tangible assets, while amortization applies to intangible assets.*

- *To ensure accuracy, you can include both depreciation and amortization if the company's Capex covers both tangible and intangible assets. ***IF THE CAPEX IS PRIMARILY FOR TANGIBLE ASSETS, YOU SHOULD ONLY USE DEPRECIATION TO AVOID INFLATING THE RATIO***, but using both provides a complete picture of how the company is allocating resources to both tangible and intangible assets.*


## What the Depreciation and Amortization Ratio Tells Us


- `Asset Maintenance vs. Growth` --> *It shows whether a company is merely maintaining its existing asset base or actively expanding.*

- `Sustainability of Free Cash Flow` --> *High Capex relative to depreciation can mean lower short-term free cash flow but could lead to long-term benefits if the investments yield high returns.*

- `Capital Efficiency` --> *A balanced ratio supports sustainable growth and competitiveness without overburdening the company’s financials.*


## Implications of Changes in the Depreciation and Amortization Ratio


1. `Increased Capex` --> *A higher Capex investment compared to depreciation signals growth or upgrading of assets, potentially positioning the company for future revenue growth.*

    - *Indicates aggressive investment in new assets.*

    - *Could imply expansion or modernization, which may enhance future capacity and revenues.*

    - *However, if not managed well, it could strain cash flows.*

2. `Decreased Capex` --> *If Capex falls below depreciation consistently, it may indicate the company is not maintaining its asset base, which could lead to operational inefficiencies or increased maintenance costs in the future.*

    - *May suggest underinvestment in assets, which could lead to aging equipment or infrastructure.*

    - *Might indicate the company is in a phase of capital conservation or struggling financially.*
