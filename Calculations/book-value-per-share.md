# `Book Value Per Share`


*Book value per share (BVPS) measures a firm's common equity divided by its number of shares outstanding. BVPS indicates a firm's net asset value (NAV) or total assets minus total liabilities per share.*


> *A good book value per share is one that is above the current stock price. This means that the company is trading below its assets and would be a good investment opportunity.*
