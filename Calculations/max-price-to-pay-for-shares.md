# Warren Buffett's Approach to Valuing Companies with Stable Cash Flows


*This calculation focuses on determining the maximum price you should pay for a company’s shares based on its cash profits (or "owner earnings") relative to prevailing interest rates (adjusted for inflation and risk).*


## Example Calculation


Suppose we have the following data:

1. `Cash Profits per Share` --> $11.60/per share
2. `Interest Rate` --> 4.4% (UK inflation + 3%)
3. `Margin of Safety` --> 15% (1 - 0.15 ==> 0.85)

4. `Maximum Price`:

    - $11.60 / 0.044 ==> ≈ $263.60

5. `Ideal Price (15% Discount)`:

    - $263.60 * 0.85 = $224.06

6. `Cash Yield at Ideal Price`:

    - 11.6 / 224 ==> 5.18%

## What Is This Method?


1. `Owner Earnings` --> *The method calculates a company's owner earnings or cash profits per share.*

2. `Risk-Adjusted Yield` --> *Divides the cash profits by a chosen interest rate (government bond yield + an adjustment for inflation or risk). This gives the maximum valuation for the shares.*

3. `PE Multiple Comparison` --> *This maximum price can also be converted into a price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for context.*


## Why Is It Useful?


1. `Valuing Predictable Companies`:

    - *This method works best for companies with steady and predictable cash flows, like Coca-Cola or Domino's Pizza.*

    - *It allows you to avoid speculative growth assumptions and focus on current earnings.*

2. `Setting a Buy or Target Price`:

    - *The calculation sets a price limit for what you should pay based on reasonable assumptions about interest rates and inflation.*

3. `Margin of Safety`:

    - *Helps you avoid overpaying for quality companies even in environments of low bond yields or inflation.*

4. `Guide for Selling`:

    - *This framework also helps determine when a share price exceeds its fair valuation, signaling a potential sell opportunity.*


## What the Maximum Price Tells Us


1. `Maximum Price` --> *This is the theoretical price you should not exceed based on cash profits and risk-adjusted interest rates. Paying more would require you to rely on future growth assumptions, which can be risky.*

2. `Ideal Price` --> *Applying a discount (e.g., 15%) to the maximum price provides a target price that ensures a margin of safety.*

3. `Cash Yield at Ideal Price` --> *This tells you the effective return on your investment if you purchase the stock at the ideal price.*


## Key Takeaways


1. `Buy Only Below the Ideal Price` --> *Purchasing at or below the ideal price ensures a sufficient margin of safety.*

2. `Sell When Valuation Exceeds a Threshold` --> *If the share price exceeds the maximum price by a certain percentage (e.g., 25%), it might be time to sell.*

3. `Adjust for Low Interest Rates` --> *If bond yields are abnormally low, apply inflation or historical averages to avoid paying inflated prices.*

4. `Target High-Quality Companies` --> *This method is most suitable for reliable, cash-generating businesses.*
