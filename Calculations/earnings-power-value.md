# Earnings Power Value (EPV)


> `DO NOT BUY A SHARE OF A COMPANY WHERE MORE THAN HALF ITS SHARE PRICE IS RELIANT ON FUTURE PROFITS GROWTH !!!`


*Earnings Power Value (EPV) estimates the value of a company based solely on its current, normalized cash profits, assuming no future growth. It focuses on what the business is worth today, given its ability to generate steady profits over time.*


## Example Calculation


Suppose we have the following data:

1. `Operating Income (EBIT)` --> $600 million
2. `Depreciation and Amortization` --> $50 million
3. `Capital Expenditures (Stay-in-Business CapEx)` --> $30 million
4. `Income Before Tax` --> $550 million
5. `Income Tax Expense` --> $110 million
6. `Total Debt` --> $200 million
7. `Cash and Equivalents` --> $100 million
8. `Shares Outstanding` --> 500 million
9. `Required Interest Rate` --> 8%


1. Calculate Normalized Cash Profit:

    - EBIT + Depreciation - CapEx ==> 600 + 50 − 30 = $620M

2. Tax the Result:

    - Tax Rate ==> 110 / 550 = 20%

    - After-Tax Cash Profit ==> 620 * (1 − 0.20) = $496M

3. Enterprise Value (EV):

    - EV ==> After-Tax Cash Profit / Interest Rate ==> 496 / 0.08 = 6,200M

4. Adjust for Debt and Cash:

    - Equity Value ==> 6,200 − 200 + 100 = 6,100M

5. EPV Per Share:

    - EPV Per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding ==> 6,100 / 500 = $12.20 per share

## Why It's Useful


- `Avoid Overpaying for Growth` --> *EPV isolates the value of the company's existing profitability without relying on speculative future growth.*

- `Detects Overpriced or Underpriced Stocks` --> *By comparing EPV to the current share price, you can identify whether a stock is trading at a premium or discount relative to its earnings-generating capacity.*

- `Risk Management` --> *Stocks priced close to or below their EPV are less risky because you're paying for what the company is already generating, rather than what it might achieve in the future.*


## What EPV Per Share Tells Us


1. `Fair Value of the Stock`

    - *If the current share price is close to or below EPV per share, the stock might be fairly valued or undervalued.*

    - *If the share price is significantly higher than EPV, a large portion of the price depends on future growth.*

2. `Margin of Safety`

    - *A stock priced below EPV offers a cushion, making it more attractive for conservative investors.*

3. `Growth Expectations`

    - *A significant gap between the current price and EPV means the market expects substantial profit growth. This can be an opportunity or a red flag depending on your confidence in the company's prospects.*


## How EPV Complements Other Valuations


- `Comparison to DCF` --> *Unlike a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, EPV doesn’t incorporate growth assumptions, making it simpler and less subjective.*

- `Supports Cash Yield` --> *EPV and cash yield both emphasize actual, tangible profitability, ensuring you evaluate what the business earns today.*


## Interpretation


- Compare the EPV per share to the current share price.

    - *If the current share price is significantly higher, A LARGE PORTION OF THE PRICE IS BASED ON FUTURE GROWTH EXPECTATIONS.*

    - *IF THE CURRENT SHARE PRICE IS NEAR OR BELOW EPV, THE STOCK MAY BE UNDERVALUED.*
