# `Operating Cash Conversion Ratio`


*Operating cash conversion ratio tells us how good a company is at turning its operating profits (EBIT) into cash. The way to measure this is with the operating cash conversion ratio, which is defined as:*


(`Operating Cash Flow` / `Operating Profit`) * `100`


> *The cash conversion ratio is a financial metric that shows how well a company converts its sales into actual cash flow. It reflects the effectiveness of a business in managing its working capital and converting profits into cash. A high CCR indicates a company is efficient in collecting cash.*

> *If the ratio is greater than 100% (or higher than 1x) this indicates good liquidity and a healthy cash conversion ratio. If it is lower than 100%, we can assume the CCR is weak, although this may be dependent on the sector or market conditions at the time. If the CCR is negative, then the company is loss making. ***WE WANT TO SEE A COMPANY CONSISTENTLY TURNING ALL ITS OPERATING PROFITS INTO OPERATING CASH FLOW. THIS WILL BE REFLECTED BY AN OPERATING CASH CONVERSION RATIO OF 100% OR ABOVE***!*
