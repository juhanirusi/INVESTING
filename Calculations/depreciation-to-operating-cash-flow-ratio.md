# Depreciation to Operating Cash Flow Ratio


*The Depreciation to Operating Cash Flow Ratio is a financial metric that measures how much of a company's operating cash flow is consumed by depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses. This ratio can indicate the extent to which a company's cash flows are tied up in maintaining its capital assets (property, plant, equipment, machinery, etc.), rather than being available for other uses like growth, paying dividends, or reducing debt.*


(`Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)` / `Operating Cash Flow (OCF)`) * 100


> *A HIGH RATIO (E.G., ABOVE 30%) SUGGESTS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OPERATING CASH FLOW IS TIED UP IN COVERING THE DEPRECIATION OF EXISTING ASSETS, IMPLYING THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REINVEST HEAVILY IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CAPEX) JUST TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT OPERATIONS.*

> *A low ratio indicates that the company generates a substantial amount of operating cash flow relative to its depreciation expenses, leaving more cash available for other purposes.*

## Why It's Important


- `Capital Intensity` --> *Companies with high depreciation expenses relative to operating cash flow are typically more capital-intensive. They may need to spend more on maintaining or replacing assets, which can limit their ability to invest in growth or return cash to shareholders.*

- `Efficiency` --> *A low ratio can be an indicator of a company's efficiency in generating cash flows with relatively low ongoing capital maintenance costs.*
