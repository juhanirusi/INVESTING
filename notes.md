# `Notes`


1. *According to the book "How To Pick Quality Shares" **`a 10-year rising EBIT`** is a great way to see if a company is able to raise their profits through different economic cycles, the good and the bad ones.*

2. *ROCE shows how much every dollar invested returns back, for example if a company has a ROCE of 67%, it means/SEEMS that **`for every $100 the company invests, it returns $67 back`**. We said seems because it's not always as simple as that.*

3. *When the gross profit, operating profits and EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) of a company increases more than their sales, it's a good indicator, because it shows that the company is making more money from selling its products or services.*
